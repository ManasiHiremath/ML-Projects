--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Course Ensemble Techniques
Diagnosing Parkinson's disease using Random Forests
This project involved using classification algorithms and Ensemble techniques to diagnose Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) using the patient voice recording data. Various models were used including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc. and comparison of accuracy across these models was done to finalise the model for prediction.

Skills and Tools
#### EDA, Logistic regression, Decision Trees
