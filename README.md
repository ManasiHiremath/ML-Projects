### Supervised Learning
Identifying potential customers for loans
Identified potential loan customers for Thera Bank using classification techniques. Compared models built with Logistic Regression and KNN algorithm in order to select the best performing one.

Skills and Tools
#### Logistic Regression, KNN, Classification
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Ensemble Techniques
Diagnosing Parkinson's disease using Random Forests
This project involved using classification algorithms and Ensemble techniques to diagnose Parkinson’s Disease (PD) using the patient voice recording data. Various models were used including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc. and comparison of accuracy across these models was done to finalise the model for prediction.

Skills and Tools
#### EDA, Logistic regression, Decision Trees

## Featurization, Model Selection & Tuning

The project was accomplished by employing supervised learning, ensemble modelling and unsupervised learning techniques to build and train a prediction model to identify Pass/Fail yield of a particular process entity for a semiconductor manufacturing company. This projects helps to determine key factors contributing to yield excursions downstream in the process and will enable an increase in process throughput, decreased time to learning and reduce the per unit production costs.

Skills and Tools
#### Supervised learning, PCA, Feature selection, Model tuning, Grid Search

## Recommendation Systems
This project replicates a real time use case of an e-commerce company, which can recommend mobile phones to a user, which are most popular and personalized respectively. The project was accomplished by employing recommendation techniques such as popularity based recommendation and collaborative filtering methods to recommend a mobile handset to its users based on the individual consumer’s behaviour/choice. Domain- Electronics, E-commerce

Skills and Tools
#### Collaborative Filtering, Popularity-based, Recommender Systems, Python
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Neural Networks & Deep Learning

The project was accomplished by delivering 4 sub-projects. Part 1,2 & 3 deploys a GUI powered by the neural network to build a regressor & classifier respectively for a communications equipment manufacturer. The model predicts the equipment’s signal quality using various parameters from its products, which is responsible for emitting informative signals. Part 4 delivers an image classifier, which can classify numbers from the photographs captured at street level using a Neural Network

Skills and Tools
#### Autonomous Vehicles, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, TensorFlow,, Image Recognition, Electronics and Telecommunication
